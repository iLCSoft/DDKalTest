## Description

Re-implentation of some of the code in KalDet, now using the DDRec:Surface provided by a DD4hep based tracking geometry as input for the measurement surfaces needed in KalTest. Intersection calculation is currently done in aidaTT. Material effects use averaged material from the DDRec:Surface.

Main classes:

* cylindrical measurement layers (1D,2D):
  * DDCylinderMeasLayer
  * DDCylinderHit

* planar measurement layers (1D,2D, along and orthogonal to z):
  * DDParallelPlanarMeasLayer
  * DDPlanarMeasLayer
  * DDDiskMeasLayer ( same as DDPlanarMeasLayer)
  * DDPlanarHit

* generic detector set up from a DD4hep based tracking model
  * DDKalDetector

* measurement layer base classes: handles material effects (E-loss and MSq)
  * DDVMeasLayer
