# v01-07

* 2022-06-24 Daniel Jeans ([PR#13](https://github.com/iLCSoft/DDKalTest/pull/13))
  - - add missing factor 0.5 to density term of Bethe-Bloch parameterisation

* 2022-06-17 Thomas Madlener ([PR#14](https://github.com/iLCSoft/DDKalTest/pull/14))
  - Make CI use github actions instead of travis-CI

# v01-06

* 2019-02-19 Andre Sailer ([PR#11](https://github.com/iLCSoft/DDKalTest/pull/11))
  - DDPlanarMeasLayer: use proper "height" to calculate sortingPolicy for DD4hep::Trapezoids, a.k.a. TGeoTrd2
  - DDPlanarMeasLayer: if SortingPolicy value is present in the DoubleParameters extension for the DetElement of a surface use that number, plus epsilon.
  - Requires AidaSoft/DD4hep#486 to compile, iLCSoft/lcgeo#234 with an example that sets this extension

# v01-05

* 2018-01-19 Frank Gaede ([PR#8](https://github.com/iLCSoft/DDKalTest/pull/8))
  - fix all compiler warnings (gcc54-ub1604)
  - use const ptr for lcio::TrackerHit and dd4hep::Surface

* 2018-01-22 Frank Gaede ([PR#9](https://github.com/iLCSoft/DDKalTest/pull/9))
  - revert usage of const EVENT::TrackerHit*

* 2018-03-28 Marko Petric ([PR#10](https://github.com/iLCSoft/DDKalTest/pull/10))
  - Fix for the removal of DDSurfaces which have been merged into DDRec 
    -  includes from `DDSurfaces` -> `DDRec`
    - namespace `DDSurfaces` -> `dd4hep::rec`

# v01-04

* 2017-10-12 Frank Gaede ([PR#7](https://github.com/iLCSoft/DDKalTest/pull/7))
  - allow for unbounded DDCylinderMeasLayers 
     - to be used for the ILD TPC
     - if VolCylinder is marked as unbounded, we use a 'multilayer', ie.
       one layer that extends to both sides of the cathode

# v01-03-01

* 2017-06-30 Andre Sailer ([PR#6](https://github.com/iLCSoft/DDKalTest/pull/6))
  - CMake: Drop dependency on DDkalTestLibDeps.cmake

# v01-03

* 2017-05-09 Andre Sailer ([PR#3](https://github.com/iLCSoft/DDKalTest/pull/3))
  - Dropped support for root version < 6

* 2017-06-20 Andre Sailer ([PR#4](https://github.com/iLCSoft/DDKalTest/pull/4))
  - Adapt to namespace changes in DD4hep

* 2017-06-29 Andre Sailer ([PR#5](https://github.com/iLCSoft/DDKalTest/pull/5))
  - CMake Configuration cleanup: Remove linking against Geant4
  - Require CMake 3.3 (same as DD4hep)

# v01-02

* 2017-04-07 Emilia Leogrande ([PR#2](https://github.com/iLCSoft/DDKalTest/pull/2))
  - DDKalTestConf replaced by LCTrackerConf

# v01-01
A.Sailer
* DDKalTest::CellIDEncoding: implement set_encoding_string and add access protection.

F.Gaede
* fix treatment of ROOT in CMakeLists.txt

# v01-00-01
A.Sailer
* DDParallelPlanarMeasLayer: protect against basically infinite loop if phi value is very very large
* DDKaltest: Ignore warnings from external header files
 
# v01-00
F.Gaede
* fixed the sorting policy for zdisks -> major improvement in forward track fitting
* crosscheck of energy loss from aidaTT commented out
* made compatible with c++11 and ROOT6
* added DDSurfaces::ISurface* surface() and some debug output
* remove hard coded muon mass for track fits

# v00-03
F.Gaede
* use new (faster) standalone helix intersection methods
* workaround for hits that are smeared off the DDRec::surface in the old digitizer
* added DDConeMeasLayer
* fixed bug in energy loss and multiple scattering for non-planar surfaces ( compute normal at x'ing point)
* distinguish between zplanes, disks and generic planes for sorting policy
* switch back to use SurfaceHelper class in order to get all insensitive surfaces ( lost in SurfaceMap )
* fixed some compiler warnings
